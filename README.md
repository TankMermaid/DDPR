# DDPR
Developmentally Dependent Predictor of Relapse

This is the mass cytometry FCS data repository for the DDPR project.

These are original bead-normalized and debarcoded FCS files gated on lineage-negative cells (see Supplementary Fig. 1a). Patient information can be found in Supplementary Table 1, antibody staining panel Supplementary Table 2, and perturbation coditions in Suplementary Table 3. Additional information on healthy donor bone marrow samples is provided in Methods.
